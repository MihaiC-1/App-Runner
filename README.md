# App-Runner

A simple program with a simple Gui implementation where you can add to a list of program/app paths from 
your computer and from a single button you open/run them.

Yout can use it for exemple: 
1. When you open your computer you may hhave some programs that you need to run them firs. So with this
program you have the chance to open them from this app and save some time.
2. When you want to study lets say you need an music app, an textedit, an coding app/workbanch and many more.
So with this list you can open all of them with one click.

Technologies: I used Python language with libraries like Tkinter and Operating System (OS).
